-- Ogre Slayer --

Background

Ogre Slayer (working title) is a pixel-art single-combat game with a medieval fantasy theme. It plays similarly to Slay the Spire or Monster Train - the player has a deck of cards representing all possible moves, and a hand of cards to select moves from. Each turn, the player will play 1-2 cards, and draw 1 card. 

The AI opponent (an ogre named Gort) is strong but dumb. He will telegraph his next move each turn - allowing the player to make tactical choices and engage in strategy and counterplay.
 
Functionality & MVPs
 
In Ogre Slayer, users will be able to:
- Select one of 3 Weapons at the start of the game, adding unique cards to their deck (making each playthrough different).
- Select 1-2 moves each turn, and watch their character perform those moves with basic animations.
- Draw new cards to expand their move pool on future turns.
- Get killed by an Ogre probably. 
- Mute the music.

In addition, this project will include:
- Animated sprites (for player and monster)
- Music

Implementation Timeline

Friday - Watch / follow most of this gamedev tutorial video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFO_txvwK_c&t=639s. I am already an hour in and now have base functionality for navigating any sprite sheet.

Weekend - Shop for and capture all art assets. Build non-functional mockups in Canvas to ascertain their structure and layout. Experiment with sprite implementation. Write out and develop the game logic and all possible cards/moves for both player and opponent. Ascertain how the cards themselves will look / transmit info. 

Monday - Implement card art and basic hand functionality including end turn, draw, click, and play card events. 

Tuesday - Implement card logic

Wednesday - Make project flow and look nice.

Thursday Morning - Final touches
